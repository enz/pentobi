<h2>Classic Rules</h2>
<p>There are four players, Blue, Yellow, Red and Green, and a board consisting
of 20×20 squares.</p>
<p>Each player has a set of 21 pieces of his color shaped like the polyominoes
up to size five. A polyomino is a shape built from a number of squares
connected along the edges.</p>

<p>The players alternate in placing one of their pieces on the board. The first
piece of a player must cover its starting square. The starting squares are
located in the corners of the board.</p>

<p>The following pieces must be placed on empty squares such that the new piece
touches at least one piece of its own color corner-to-corner but does not touch
any piece of its own color along the edges. The new piece may touch edges of
pieces of the opponent colors.</p>

<p>When the player of a color cannot place any more pieces, the player passes
and the next color continues.</p>
<p>When none of the players can place any more pieces, the player with the
highest score wins. The score of a color is the number of squares on the board
occupied by the color, plus a bonus of 15 points if the color could place all
of its pieces, plus an additional bonus of 5 points if the color could place
all pieces and the last piece played was the one-square piece.</p>
<h3>Rules for Two Players</h3>
<p>The game can be played with two players. The first player plays both Blue
and Red, the second player Yellow and Green. The points of both colors played
by a player are added up.</p>
<h3>Rules for Three Players</h3>
<p>The game can also be played with three players. The players take turns
playing the fourth color (Green). At the end of the game, the score of Green is
ignored.</p>
<h3>Colorless starting points</h3>
<p>Note that the original Blokus Classic rules used colorless starting points.
This means that each color may freely choose, which of the remaining unoccupied
starting points to use for its first move. Pentobi currently only supports the
rule variant with colored starting points because this rule variant was used on
the Blokus online server at blokus.com and in most of the past Blokus
tournaments.</p>
