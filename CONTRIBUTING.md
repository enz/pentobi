Source Code Overview
--------------------

The Libboardgame modules contain code that is not specific to Blokus and
could be reused for other board games.

* __[libboardgame_base](libboardgame_base)__
  General utilities and functionality for board games
* __[libboardgame_gtp](libboardgame_gtp)__
  Implementation of the [Go Text Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_Text_Protocol) (GTP)
* __[libboardgame_test](libboardgame_test)__
  Functionality for unit tests
* __[libboardgame_mcts](libboardgame_mcts)__
  Abstract Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS)

The engine modules contain code that is specific to Blokus and the
computer player used in Pentobi.

* __[libpentobi_base](libpentobi_base)__
  General Blokus-specific functionality. The board implementation is
  optimized for fast move generation needed in MCTS. For a definition
  of the game file format, see [Pentobi-SGF](libpentobi_base/Pentobi-SGF.md)
* __[libpentobi_gtp](libpentobi_gtp)__
  General Blokus-specific GTP interface based on libboardgame_gtp and
  libpentobi_base.
* __[libpentobi_mcts](libpentobi_mcts)__
  Main Blokus computer player used in Pentobi based on libboardgame_mcts
* __[opening_books](opening_books)__
  Opening moves in SGF format used by libpentobi_mcts for fast move
  generation without search in early positions
* __[learn_tool](learn_tool)__
  Tool for learning the move priors used in libpentobi_mcts
* __[pentobi_gtp](pentobi_gtp)__
  GTP interface to the player in libpentobi_mcts.
  See [Pentobi-GTP](pentobi_gtp/Pentobi-GTP.md) for more information.
* __[twogtp](twogtp)__
  Tool for playing Blokus games between two GTP engines (currently only
  supported on Unix)

The GUI module implements the user interface. It depends on the
[Qt](https://www.qt.io/) libraries.

* __[pentobi](pentobi)__
  Main program that provides a GUI for the player in libpentobi_mcts
