    <h3>How to Use Pentobi</h3>

    <h3>Board</h3>
    <p>
      Pentobi's main window shows the board on the left side.
      The played pieces on the board can have numbers on them that indicate the
      move number in which the piece was played.
      An letter after the move number indicates that there exists a variation
      to this move (see below).
    </p>
    <p>
      Pieces can be played by moving them to a place that corresponds to a
      legal move with the mouse or arrow keys and pressing the left mouse button
      or the Enter key.
    </p>

    <h3>Pieces and Score</h3>
    <p>
      On the right side, the remaining pieces are shown.
      Above the remaining pieces is an orientation selector that shows the
      currently selected piece and allows the player to change its orientation.
      If no piece is selected and the game has not yet ended, a colored dot
      in the orientation selector shows the color to play.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pieces can be selected by clicking on one of the remaining pieces shown,
      by using the left/right arrow buttons in the orientation selector
      or by using <a href="shortcuts.html">shortcut keys</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Below the orientation selector is a score display, which displays the
      current points for each color or player.
      The points are the sum of on-board points and bonus points.
      Points are underlined if they are final (because the color cannot play
      more pieces).
    </p>

    <h3>Playing Against the Computer</h3>
    <p>      
      The board can be used for entering moves played by humans or for playing
      games against the computer.
      In games against the computer, the computer can play any (or several) of
      the colors.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you start a new game of a game variant with more than two players,
      the computer plays no color by default; all colors are expected to be
      played by humans.
      If you want the computer to play a single color, you can wait
      until it is this color's turn and select <i>Play</i> from the
      <i>Computer</i> menu or toolbar.
      Selecting <i>Play</i> always makes the computer play a move for the
      current color.
      If the computer did not already play this color before, it will also make
      the computer play this color (and only this color) from now on.
      If you want the computer to play more than one color, use
      <i>Computer Colors</i> from the <i>Game</i> menu or toolbar and select
      the colors it should play.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you start a new game of a two-player game variant, the computer
      plays the color(s) of the second player by default.
      Select <i>Play</i> to make it play the color(s) of the first player
      instead.
      The exception is that the computer will play no color by default,
      if it played no color in the previous game.
      This prevents the computer from starting to play if the user
      mainly wants to use the board for entering moves played by humans.
      So if you want to use the board without playing against the computer,
      you need to disable the computer colors in the <i>Computer Colors</i>
      dialog only once and it will stay that way.
      After loading a saved game, the computer also plays no color by default.
    </p>

    <h3>Move Variations and the Game Tree</h3>
    <p>
      When you play a game, Pentobi will store the sequence of moves and
      it is always possible to go back to a previous position and play
      differently.
      If you do this, the new sequence is stored as an alternative sequence
      (called a variation).
      Variations can also be used by annotators for commenting on existing
      games.
      Variations can exist at any board position and can have subvariations
      themselves.
      The game can therefore become a game tree, in which each node represents
      a board position.
      You can navigate in the game tree with the items in the <i>Go</i> menu
      or in the toolbar.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main variation is the sequence of moves that starts at the start
      position and always selects the first child node in each position
      (e.g. by selecting <i>Forward</i> in the <i>Go</i> menu or toolbar).
      The main variation is supposed to represent the real game played.
      If you want a side variation to become the main variation, select
      <i>Make Main Variation</i> from the <i>Edit</i> menu.
