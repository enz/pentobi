<h2>Become a Stronger Player</h2>
<p>Pentobi has functionality that can help you to become a stronger Blokus
player.</p>
<h3 id="analysis">Game Analysis</h3>
<p>A game can be analyzed by selecting <i>Analyze Game</i> from the
<i>Tools</i> menu. This will make the computer player evaluate each position in
the main variation. The result is displayed in a window with a diagram of
colored dots.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="analysis.jpg" alt="Game analysis window"></p>
<div align="center" class="caption">Analysis of a game of variant Classic (2
players).</div>
<p>Each dot represents a game position in which the color of the dot was to
play. The dots are ordered horizontally by move number. The vertical axis
represents the estimated probability of winning the game for the color to play.
Mouse clicks in the diagram will go to the corresponding position.</p>
<p>The position values are only estimates and the computer will sometimes
evaluate positions incorrectly. But sudden drops in the value can help you find
moves that were potentially bad. You can go back to the position before the
move and try to find a better move or ask the computer what it would have
played by selecting <i>Play Single Move</i> from the <i>Computer</i> menu.</p>
<h3 id="rating">Determine Your Rating</h3>
<p>You can track your progress by playing rated games against the computer. The
game results are used to determine your current rating. The rating is a number
that represents your playing strength.</p>
<p>A rated game is started with <i>Rated Game</i> from the <i>Game</i> menu or
the toolbar. If you have not played any rated games in the current game
variant, you will be asked to choose a start value, which can reduce the number
of games needed for determining your real rating. If you are a beginner, leave
the start value at 800.</p>
<p>For each rated game, the computer will choose a playing level for the
computer opponent according to your current rating. The color you play will be
randomly chosen in each game.</p>
<p>During a rated game, most of the functions not needed for playing are
disabled: you cannot undo moves, navigate in the game, change the computer
colors or change the playing level. To get an accurate rating, you should
always play rated games until the end.</p>
<p>After the game has ended, your rating will be updated depending on the game
result and the computer level. For the game result, it only matters whether the
game was won, lost or a tie. The exact number of score points does not
matter.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="rating.jpg" alt="Rating window"></p>
<div align="center" class="caption">Window with rating graph.</div>
<p>You can always see your current rating by selecting <i>Rating</i> from the
<i>Tools</i> menu. This will open a window that shows the development of your
rating during the last 50 games as a graph. The last 50 games are automatically
saved and can be loaded by opening a context menu in the game table below the
graph.</p>
