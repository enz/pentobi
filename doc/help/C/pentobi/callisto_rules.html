<h2>Callisto Rules</h2>
<p>Callisto is a another board game similar to Blokus. The board is derived
from the classic 20×20 Blokus board by removing the corners such that an
octagon with a top edge of size six remains. The pieces are a subset of the
polyominoes up to size five. They include three 1×1 pieces per player that play
a special role.</p>

<p>The 1×1 pieces may be placed anywhere on the board apart from the center of
the board. The center consists of an octagon with width six and top edge size
two. The first two moves of a player must use a 1×1 piece, the third 1×1 piece
may be played anytime later.</p>

<p>All larger pieces may be placed anwhere on the board but must touch an
existing piece of the same color edge-to-edge.</p>

<p>The score of a color is the number of squares on the board occupied by the
color not counting 1×1 pieces. Bonus points are not used. Unlike in Blokus,
ties are broken in favor of the player who started later.</p>
<h3>Rules for two or three players</h3>
<p>The game can be played with less than four players by using a smaller board.
For three players, the board is an octagon with width 20 and top edge size two.
For two players, the board is an octagon with width 17 and top edge size two.
The size of the center stays the same. In addition to the standard two-player
variant, Pentobi also supports a game variant for two players like in Blokus,
in which each player plays two colors.</p>
