.TH PENTOBI 6 "2018-07-30" "Pentobi @PENTOBI_VERSION@" "Pentobi command reference"
.SH NAME
pentobi \- computer opponent for the board game Blokus
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pentobi
.RI [ options ] " [file]"
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pentobi
is the command to invoke the program Pentobi, which is a graphical user
interface and computer opponent to play the board game Blokus.
.PP
The command can take the name of a game file to open at startup as an optional
argument.
The game file is expected to be in Pentobi's SGF format as documented in
doc/blksgf/Pentobi-SGF.html in the Pentobi source package.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Display help and exit.
.TP
.B \-\-maxlevel
Set the maximum playing level. Reducing this value reduces the amount
of memory used by the search, which can be useful to run Pentobi on systems
that have low memory or are too slow to use the highest levels.
By default, Pentobi currently allocates up to 2 GB (but not more than a quarter
of the physical memory available on the system).
Reducing the maximum level to 8 currently reduces this amount by a factor
of 3 to 4 and lower maximum levels even more.
.TP
.B \-\-mobile
Use a window layout optimized for smartphones and apply some user interface
changes that assume that a touchscreen is the main input device. If this option
is not used, the default layout depends on the platform. Using this option also
changes the default style for GUI elements of QQuickControls 2 to Default if
the style is not explicitely set with option \-style.
.TP
.B \-\-nobook
Do not use opening books.
.TP
.B \-\-nodelay
Do not delay fast computer moves. By default, the computer player adds a
small delay if the move generation took less than a second to make it easier
for the human to follow the game if the computer plays several moves in a row.
.TP
.B \-\-seed
Set the seed for the random generator. Using a fixed seed makes the move
generation deterministic if no multi-threading is used (see option --threads).
.TP
.B \-\-threads
The number of threads to use in the search. By default, up to 8 threads are
used in the search depending on the number of hardware threads supported
by the current system.
Using more threads will speed up the move generation but using a very high
number of threads (e.g. more than 8) can degrade the playing strength
in higher playing levels.
.TP
.B \-\-verbose
Print internal information about the move generation and other debugging
information to standard error.
.PP
Standard options for Qt applications:
.TP
.B \-display
Switches displays on X11.
.TP
.B \-geometry
Window geometry using the X11 syntax.
.TP
.B \-style
Set the style for the GUI elements of QQuickControls 2. If no style is chosen,
the default style is Default if option \-\-mobile is set and Fusion otherwise.
